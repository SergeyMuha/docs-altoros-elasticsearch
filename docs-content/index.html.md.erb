## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

* A distributed real-time document store where every field is indexed and searchable

* A distributed search engine with real-time analytics, capable of scaling to hundreds of servers and petabytes of structured and unstructured data

## <a id='features'></a>Current Features

Altoros Elasticsearch for PCF includes the following key features:

* The possibility to use the Elasticsearch service in a multitenant mode
* Data storage in a distributed Elasticsearch cluster
* Fully-automated deployment and provisioning of an Elasticsearch installation
